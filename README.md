# Rick and Morty Character Search Application

## Project Description

This project is a character search application that allows users to search for characters by their names and surnames using a provided API. Users can enter a character's name in the search box and see all matching results displayed on the page as character cards.

## Key Features

- Focused input field for immediate user interaction.
- Automatic API requests trigger when more than three characters are entered.
- Each character card links to a unique page based on the URL field from the API.
- Informative message when no results are found.

## Design

The desktop version is implemented based on the design from [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/OqXrvb70uW6plWJYGW4cvI/Rick-nad-Morti-test?node-id=101-2&p=f&t=zrmVhbhxKpJKZ5IE-0).
The application supports responsive design from 320px to 1920px, adjusting the number of character cards displayed per row as the screen size changes.

## Technical Specifications

- Support for the latest version of Chrome.
- Developed using React.
- Code is formatted using ESLint, eslint-config-prettier, and eslint-config-airbnb.

## API

The application interacts with an external API to fetch character data. You can find the [API documentation here](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#rest).

## Future Improvements

When I was working on the project, I came up with several ideas for further development and improvement of this project, including:

- More detailed character cards with their location and image of the character.
- Implementation of search and filtering characters based on attributes other than names, to improve user experience.

## Conclusion

This application is designed to provide users with a simple and effective tool for finding characters from their favorite show. I hope you enjoy using it and can easily discover your beloved characters!
